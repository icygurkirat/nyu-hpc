1. vector-vector multiplication: mmultvector.cu
   matrix-vector multiplication: mmult.cu



2. jacobi-gpu.cu is the implementation of 2D jacobi algorithm in CUDA. I have also provided the jacobi-cpu.cpp file for comparison which contains the implementation using CPU.
    The results obtained are exactly indentical.

    For doing a jacobi iteration, I am using the kernel: jacobi_kernel(). It applies the convolution and leverages shared memory for faster calculation.
    For calculting norm of difference, I am using two kernels: diff_convolution() and reduction_kernel().
